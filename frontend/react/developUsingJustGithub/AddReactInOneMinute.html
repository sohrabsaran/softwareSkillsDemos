    This page is an adaption of the example given <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-react-in-one-minute">here</a>.
    
    This page demonstrates using React using just thee Github web interface, i.e: 
      - We can edit code in Github online editor and changes will be automatically deployed to github pages.
      - There is no upload, download, local dev env etc. needed. This is fast for prototyping. 
    
    On the other hand, React libs are loaded without removing unwanted parts. So production websites will be slower to load.
    For JSX support without building we have to use babel, which again increases the loading time and maybe degrades performance beyond just the website loading performance. 
    Also Babel seems to have some issues with the ES6 import and export syntax.
    Alternatives are to directly use React.createElement() (simple, straightforward) or to use https://github.com/developit/htm

    <!-- We will put our React component inside this div. -->
    <div id="like_button_container"></div>

    <!-- Load React. -->
    <!-- Note: when deploying, replace "development.js" with "production.min.js". 
    TODO: what exactly are the difference between the two versions?

        From https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx
        The quickest way to try JSX in your project is to add the following script:
    -->
    <!-- 
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@latest/babel.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    -->
  
    <!--
        Now you can use JSX in any <script> tag by adding type="text/babel" attribute to it.
    -->
   <!-- <script type="text/babel" data-plugins="transform-es2015-modules-umd">//type="module" -->
   <script type="module">
    import LikeButton from './LikeButton.js';
    const domContainer = document.querySelector('#like_button_container');

    //see https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement
    //You will not typically invoke React.createElement() directly if you are using JSX.
    //However as per https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html you may need build env for JSX.
    ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(LikeButton), domContainer);
