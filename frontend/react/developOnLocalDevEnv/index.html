<i>My notes are in green italics:</i>

Success! Created my-app at D:\checkoutsFromGitRepositories\github.com.sohrabsaran\softwareSkillsDemos\frontend\react\developOnLocalDevEnv\my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server. <i>Somehow works even if homepage attribute is set/changed in package.json.</i> 

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production. 
    <i>These files are available in chunks (no longer a single bundle.js) in the 'build' folder.
    Chunks are used among other things, to reduce the loading time (see <a href="https://medium.com/jspoint/react-router-and-webpack-v4-code-splitting-using-splitchunksplugin-f0a48f110312">here</a> for more details). 
    The easiest way I found to deploy, was to commit this folder and so comment out 'build' from .gitignore.
    Then set homepage attribute in package.json to the corresponding <a href="https://sohrabsaran.github.io/softwareSkillsDemos/frontend/react/developOnLocalDevEnv/my-app/build">github page url</a>.
    The build then gets deployed to this url, whenever 'npm run build' is done, and the changes to the build folder are committed.
    </i>
    
  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!

The project was built assuming it is hosted at /.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build

<div id="withTypescriptDiv" data-title="With Typescript">

Setup: see <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/">here</a>. I named my app react-typescript-app.

The output of 'npx create-react-app react-typescript-app --template typescript' is identical to the output of the without-typescript 'npx create-react-app...' command.
Deployment steps are also identical; the app is deployed <a href="https://sohrabsaran.github.io/softwareSkillsDemos/frontend/react/developOnLocalDevEnv/react-typescript-app/build">here</a>.
