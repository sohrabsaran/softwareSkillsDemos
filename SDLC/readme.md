All type of software projects are ultimately subsets of maintenance projects.

# Challenges in maintenance projects and their solutions
- Don't remember the project goal: document it
- Competing approach: list the pros and cons and then take a decision on which approach
- Can't remember what a particular piece of code does - do refactoring
- Code getting too complex - break it into multiple files and smaller functions. Increase the documentation.
- Getting old and forgetful - put things in clear, globally accessible places, take proper backups.
- Task seems to be taking too long - measure progress and work remaining.
